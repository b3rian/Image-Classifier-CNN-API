**# ðŸ§  Image Classifier API & UI â€” ResNet50 & EfficientNetV2L

This project is a full-stack deep learning deployment pipeline for image classification using two powerful models: ResNet50 and EfficientNetV2L. It showcases the training of high-performance models, REST API development using FastAPI, and a Streamlit frontend that allows users to interact with the models through a user-friendly web interface. The project is containerized with Docker and CI/CD automated using GitHub Actions. It is deployed to production via Hugging Face Spaces and Streamlit Community Cloud.

# ðŸš€ Project Features

âœ… Trained **ResNet50** and **EfficientNetV2L** on ImageNet using Tensorflow distributed training on 2 GPUs.

âœ… Achieved **top-1 accuracy** of:

ResNet50: **80%**, EfficientNetV2L: **86%**

âœ… Achieved top-5 accuracy of:

ResNet50: 90%, EfficientNetV2L: 96%

âœ… Built a FastAPI backend to serve model predictions.

âœ… Built a Streamlit frontend that:

Accepts user images.

Lets users choose between ResNet50, EfficientNetV2L, or both.

âœ… Integrated the backend and frontend to work seamlessly.

âœ… Dockerized both API and frontend.

âœ… Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

âœ… Deployed:

API to Hugging Face Spaces

Frontend to Streamlit Community Cloud

âœ… Achieves average response latency of ~2.5 seconds.**
